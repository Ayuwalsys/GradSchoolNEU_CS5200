### We recorded a total number of `r total_visits_unique_restaurants$Total_Visits` visits across `r total_visits_unique_restaurants$Unique_Restaurants` different restaurants from `r date_range$Start_Year` to `r date_range$End_Year`. The average amount spent for a visit across all restaurants is `r round(avg_std_amount$Average_Amount, 1)` (Ïƒ = `r round(avg_std_amount$Std_Dev_Amount, 1)`). The most visits were at `r most_visits$restaurant` while the largest revenue across all years was at `r largest_revenue$restaurant`. The average size of a party was `r round(avg_party_size$Average_Party_Size, 0)` and `r round(wine_percentage$Wine_Percentage, 1)`% of all parties consumed wine.


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
